Credit where credit is due

If you use a stock texture please acknowledge my creative efforts and do the following:
 o  you MUST acknowledge your source material in the artist comments below your deviation, together with a link to the texture pack deviation and/or to me: ~BirdseyeStock
 o  leave a comment or note me with a link to your deviation, I like to see what people have done
 o  add the stock deviation to your DA faves so others can find and enjoy them too
 o  for artwork outside DeviantArt please credit your sources and note me with a link
 o  if you think something is cool then by all means tell your friends and share it online but do so by *linking* to the original deviation rather than copying the images elsewhere. Thanks!


Questions?
----------
For any other questions regarding usage, please ask first! I will probably be happy to oblige.


I hope you agree that these terms of use are fair and reasonable. 
Thank you for respecting and honoring my wishes. 
Now go and be creative (and show me your work afterwards)! :D

How to create a seamless tiled texture in Photoshop:
---------------------------------------------------
1. Open the desired texture image from this zip file in Photoshop, re-size it if required.

2. Use "Define Pattern" command from the Edit menu to create a stored fill pattern.

3. To fill a large area with the tiled pattern use the "Fill" command on the Edit menu. 
Make sure "Pattern" is selected in this dialog and use the "Custom Pattern" dropdown list to
locate the new fill pattern you created in step 2 above.
